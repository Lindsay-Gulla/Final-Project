      <h2>When Should a Comedian Apologize?</h2>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p>When should a comedian apologize? Generally speaking, when a joke is made outside of the comedian&rsquo;s marginality and it is so offensive that it affects a group of people. Marginality is a comedian&rsquo;s authority to make a joke because they fall into the category they are making fun of. For example, when Ellen did stand-up comedy she often made lesbian jokes; she had the authority to do so because she is a gay woman. Family Guy makes fun of every group of people from religion to race to gender, that is its marginality; every group is subjected to the same ridicule. An example of a comedian joking outside of his marginality was the Gilbert Gottfried scandal. Gilbert Gottfried tweeted and broadcasted many jokes about the tsunami that occurred in Japan. Many people were angered by it and thought that he lacked compassion for the victims. He was fired as the spokesperson for Aflac Inc., as it derives about three-quarters of its revenue in Japan. This leads to a few questions, if the tsunami had occurred in the United States, would he have made those jokes? If it had occurred in the U.S. would the jokes be acceptable because he would fit the marginality? Was it the joke or the timing? He wrote a series of tweets beginning a day after the Tsunami occurred. According to May&rsquo;s analysis of the Hurricane Sandy study, these tweets were written way too close to the actual event. If Gilbert had tweeted these jokes a few months after the tsunami, it is possible that they would have been received differently. Gottfried released a statement a few days later: &ldquo;I sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my attempt at humor regarding the tragedy in Japan. I meant no disrespect, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families,&rdquo; (Cina, 2011). </p>
