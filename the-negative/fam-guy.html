      <h2>Family Guy Examples</h2>
      <p>In <em>Padre de Familia</em> (2007), Peter becomes extremely patriotic.  After Brian accused Peter of not knowing what 9/11 meant until 2004, Peter responds, &quot;That's not true, Brian. I remember 9/11.&quot;&nbsp;Then there is a cutaway of Lois sitting on the couch crying. Peter goes through the living room, shortly looks at the TV and then turns to Lois and says: &quot;Must have been a woman pilot, huh?&quot; (Macfarlane, 2007, &ldquo;Padre De Familia&rdquo;). This joke was found offensive by Fox TV; they did not air this scene on television. It causes uproar amongst the news outlets and various bloggers. This clip appeared on many sites that discuss Family Guy&rsquo;s most offensive jokes. </p>
      <p><br>
        The joke is a play on the stereotype that women are bad drivers; however, Peter&rsquo;s reaction to this devastating news is very offensive. He laughs it off and blames women for the tragic attack on our country. Unlike the other two jokes, this joke directly comments on the attacks themselves. The image of Lois crying on the couch is probably vivid for most people, in that Americans had no choice but to stay home and watch TV for the update. The fact that this situation is so realistic to what actually occurred, we could put ourselves in Lois&rsquo; shoes and see how horrible Peter&rsquo;s comment was. The other jokes do not reference the actual crash or any type of realistic reenactment of what actually occurred. This leads to the question of ethics; do comedians have an ethical duty to report the news in a humorous way, when are jokes unethical?</p>
      <p>____________________________________________</p>
<p>Another joke that is very offensive is in <em>Tiegs for Two</em> (2011), when Peter makes fun of Michael J. Fox. Peter basically says he lost one of his white shirts because Michael J. Fox spilled wine on it. It goes to a cutaway with just Peter talking where he informs the viewer that they have a clip but he will tell the story himself because it would be in bad taste, so he tells the viewer that he was at Michael J. Fox&rsquo;s house and he spilt wine all over his shirt. </p>
      <p>Peter says he was very nice and offered to pay for the shirt but he sent me this check (shows a check with scribbles).  Peter then says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we took the high road on this one… what&rsquo;s that, wait now they&rsquo;re telling me   they do want to show it.&rdquo;  This joke is particularly interesting because Peter calls himself out on the nature of the joke by saying &ldquo;we are taking the high road&rdquo; (Macfarlane, 2011, &ldquo;Tiegs for Two&rdquo;).  </p>
