      <h2>The Positive Aspects of Humor</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When I was a senior in high school, my only grandmother passed of old age. I only ever knew one of my grandparents, so when she passed it was a very emotional time for my family and me. When I think back on the situation, I remember being in the hospital with my grandmother and my family just waiting for her to pass. With that being said, I also remember laughing a lot during that time. </p>
      <p>After days of grieving, it seemed that humor was the best way to deal with her death. We laughed about how funny she was in her day. She always made up words and sayings that we never knew if they were actually real resulting in an afternoon looking at a dictionary and laughing. Most significantly, I remember my family being together. Although we were all sad, our sense of humor helped us all grieve together in our own way. It helped us remember my grandmother in a good light, instead of the woman who was lying on the hospital bed.</p>
      <p> Humor helped my family and me get through this tragic time. This response is not unusual, many people, groups of people, families, and nations use humor to help them cope with tragedy. Although this is not always the appropriate initial reaction, with time, humor is the best way to relieve sadness and anxiety. Humor when used as a coping mechanism, can shed light on issues or tragedy; however, in order to be well received, these jokes must be precise in timing and context. </p>
