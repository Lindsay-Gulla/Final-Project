      <h2>Political Satire</h2>
      <p>Humor can be used objectively to prove a point about one&rsquo;s actions; this is most useful when it comes to politics. Humor is impartial; by poking fun at politicians it helps them recognize a point of view about them in a lighter way. Comedians that focus on political satire often have an opinion that intends to persuade voters within the joke. </p>
      <p>This is a tricky situation in that people are persuaded almost unconsciously. When a person knows they are being persuaded, they may avoid the message, question the bias, or ignore it completely in order to hold on to their own beliefs. However, humor does not general have this stigma, political satire uses humor to shield its intention (Holbert, Tchernev, Walther, Esralew, Benski, 2013). &ldquo;Humor may distract the audience from the core arguments of a message by increasing demand on cognitive resources, thus lowering the ability to counter-argue&rdquo; (Holbert et al., 2013). In other words, people will register a joke and what it means but they will not argue with it because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a joke!&rdquo; Because of the way the information is presented, the receiver is less likely to argue back. Most jokes are a closed ended statement, as opposed to a debate or a simple opinion-based statement that leaves room for interpretation and response. </p>
      <p><br>
        The intersection between humor specifically satire and politics proves that comedians have a purpose or message behind the jokes that they make. When people listen to satirist they consider the person&rsquo;s motivation behind the joke but they do not often question why the joke was written, what its purpose is. Some comedians believe it is their ethical duty to provoke politicians to keep them in check. </p>
<p>One major criticism of political satire persuasion is that unlike debates or speeches, there is no call for movement&rdquo; (HolbertÂ  et al., 2013). In other words, humor presents an issue, pokes fun at it, but does not propose a solution for it. Comedians believe that they can affect the popular opinion and even influence the politicians. For example, comedian, Robert Mankoff states, &ldquo;1) Politicians behaving badly will be mocked. 2) Politicians don&rsquo;t like to be mocked. 3) Politicians will stop behaving badly&rdquo; (How does satire influence politics?, 2012). This public display of covering the news using humor comedians act as a checks and balances for politicians. </p>
